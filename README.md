# Gloomhave Game Assist - CSCI 487: Senior Project

Gloomhaven is a complex and cooperative board game in which up to four players control characters that progress through a story of different scenarios. This project has two purposes: To aid players with managing their different parties that include the characters if they play multiple Gloomhaven sessions at once and tracking the conditions, health and experience, and other statistics regarding in-game characters and enemies. The methods to attempt to achieve those purposes were to implement a relational database to store the data for the users, parties, characters, items, and scenarios so that users could login/sign up to the website application, create/view/update/delete the parties and characters. Overall, this project fell short of the original purposes by only allowing users to login/sign up and to track just the enemy conditions and statistics without having the other tables implemented with the relational database.
